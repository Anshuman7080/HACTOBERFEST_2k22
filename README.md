# About
<hr/>

This Repository is for all the beginners to be familiar with the concept and culture of Open Souce Contributions. This will serve as a basic layout for the beginners to know how things work in open source/ github.
To make it very user friendly I have tried to comment outside the same thing and get the explanation to the line.

Some of the topics include :

* HTML
* CSS files. 
* React projects.

As a part of Hacktoberfest Code of Conduct no spamming or irrelevant PRs will be accepted.
